# June Celebration :corn:

### Description

There will be a June party and we have a list of boys and girls to dance the gang! The lists are like this:
```
let boys = ["Bento", "Zé", "Chico", "Jão"];

let girls = ["Maria", "Josefa", "Florentina", "Francisca"];
```
You must <b>print on the console</b> all the possibilities for couples to dance the gang.

Show in the end how many couples were formed.

#### BONUS :star:
The gang no longer has the rule that the couple has to be a boy / girl.

## How to Run
- Clone this repository
- Open the project folder
